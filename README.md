# Plinko

This is a small Pusheen-themed game that can be played as a rendition of the popular physical Plinko game. In the game, you must use the arrow keys and space bar to drop balls into a moving basket, earning you points. 

In order to run this, before cloning the repository, you must download MIXR version 18.01 from the website: https://www.mixr.dev/downloads.html.
